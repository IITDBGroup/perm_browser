Perm Browser Application
--------------------------------

1) ABOUT
--------------------------------
The Perm Browser is a Java Gui application that can be used to connect to a Perm server and
execute queries. It demonstrates the query rewrites applied by Perm by presenting the rewritten
query as plain SQL and the original and rewritten algebra trees.

2) PREQUISITES
--------------------------------
-Mac OS X or Windows
-Java 1.5 or newer
-Graphviz (dot)
-Perm server
-Apache Ant

3) INSTALL
--------------------------------
The main folder contains an Ant script. Make sure you have Ant installed on your machine.
Change into the folder and call ant

> ant 

This will compile the Perm Browser application and generate a PermBrowser.app bundle in the
build subdirectory. This is the Mac OS X version of the application. The windows version
is found in build/BrowserWin.

4) CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------
For the application to work properly you have to adjust the configuration file found in

PermBrowser/Contents/MacOS/resource/conf/general.txt 	(MAC OS)
BrowserWin/resource/conf/general.txt					(WINDOWS)

You'll have to apply the following changes:

-change the "DotCommand" parameter so that it points to the dot executable on your system.
-adapt the database connection options to fit your Perm server installation:
	-DB.User 				(database user to use for the connection. default is postgres)
	-DB.Url					(IP of the machine the Perm server runs on. default is 127.0.0.1)
	-DB.DatabaseName 		(name of the database to connect too. default is demo)
	-DB.Password			(password for the user to connect with. default is none)
	
5) RUN
--------------------------------
Mac OS X: Double-Click the PermBrowser.app bundle or start PermBrowser/Contents/MacOS/runMac.sh from the terminal

Windows: Start runWin.bat

6) USAGE
--------------------------------
Type in queries (with or without provenance computation) in the Query text field. Hit run to execute a query
and observe the query result, rewritten query SQL text, and original and rewritten algebra trees. The folder
demodb contains a SQL script that generates a small demonstration database (use e.g. psql to run the script). You can load
some precooked queries from the resource/logs folder using the File application menu of the browser application.
