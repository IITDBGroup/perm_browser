Perm Browser Application
--------------------------------

1) ABOUT
--------------------------------
The Perm Browser is a Java Gui application that can be used to
connect to a Perm server and execute queries. It demonstrates the 
query rewrites applied by Perm by presenting the rewritten
query as plain SQL and the original and rewritten algebra trees.

2) PREQUISITES
--------------------------------
-Mac OS X, Linux or Windows
-Java 1.5 or newer
-Graphviz (dot)
-Perm server
-Apache Ant

3) INSTALL
--------------------------------
The main folder contains an Ant build file. Make sure you have Ant
installed on your machine. Change into the Perm Browser folder 
and call ant:

> ant 

This will compile the Perm Browser application and build an executable 
in the 'build' directory: 
	-PermBrowser.app bundle (Mac OS X)
	-BrowserWin/RunWin.bat (Windows)
	-BrowserLinux/startBrowser.sh (Linux)
	 

4) CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------
a) For the application to work properly you have to adjust the 
configuration file found in

PermBrowser/Contents/MacOS/resource/conf/general.txt 	(Mac OS X)
BrowserWin/resource/conf/general.txt					(Windows)
BrowserLinux/resource/conf/general.txt					(Linux)

You'll have to apply the following changes:

-change the "DotCommand" parameter so that it points to the dot
executable on your system.
-adapt the database connection options to fit your Perm server
installation:
	-DB.User 				(database user to use for the connection.
							 default is postgres)
	-DB.Url					(IP of the machine the Perm server runs 
							on. default is 127.0.0.1)
	-DB.DatabaseName 		(name of the database to connect too. 
							default is demo)
	-DB.Password			(password for the user to connect with. 
							default is none)
	
b) Create the demo database: 

-Start your perm server and create the database you have set in general.txt 
or if it already exists connect to it using psql.

-(Optional): Load the demodb/demo.sql script (with '\i') to be able to run
some predefined demo queries.
	
5) RUN
--------------------------------
Mac OS X: 	Double-Click the PermBrowser.app bundle or start 
			PermBrowser/Contents/MacOS/runMac.sh from the terminal

Windows: 	Start runWin.bat

Linux: 		Start startBrowser.sh

6) USAGE
--------------------------------
Type in queries (with or without provenance computation) in the Query text
field. Hit run to execute a query and observe the query result, rewritten 
query SQL text, and original and rewritten algebra trees. The folder
demodb contains a SQL script that generates a small demonstration database 
(use e.g. psql to run the script). All queries executed in a session are available
in the drop down menu above the run button. This execution history can be saved to 
disk or loaded from a file. You can load some precooked queries from
the resource/logs folder using the File application menu of the browser 
application.
